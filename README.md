# BouncingCubeThing
Its a simple bouncing cube complete with setup.

*THIS SCRIPT REQUIRES PYGAME*
Pygame is installable using: "pip install pygame".
https://pygame.org


The setup should help you through the start.
The default config is made for testing.
This is my first real project in python.

The commands for setup include:
-help
-start
-version
-colour
-resolution
-speed
-exit
-spos
-fps
-background
-size
-config
-drawbg

These must be written in all lowercase or else they don't work.
