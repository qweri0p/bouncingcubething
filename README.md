# BouncingCubeThing
Its a simple bouncing cube complete with setup.

*THIS SCRIPT REQUIRES [PYGAME](https://pygame.org)*

[Pygame](https://pygame.org) is installable using: "pip install pygame".



The setup should help you through the start.
The default config is made for testing.
This is my first real project in python.

The commands for setup include:
* help
* start
* version
* colour
* resolution
* speed
* exit
* spos
* fps
* background
* size
* config
* drawbg


These must be written in all lowercase or else they don't work.
